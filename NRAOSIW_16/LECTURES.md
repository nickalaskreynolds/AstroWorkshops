- LoFAR
- vlwa
- interferometry and synthesis in radio astronomy thomson moran swensen on link.spring.com for FREE
- good interferometry simulator...https://launchpad.net/apsynsim

### LISA YOUNG - General Radio Astronomy
#### Presentation
- Draine and Li 2007.....modified black bodies
- free-free emission.....electron accelerating around proton. has a characteristic flat region in the spectrum. proportional to #electrons * #ionized particles / T^1/2. So as #increase, approach Black body
- synchrotron       .....nonthermal, relativistic, electrons in B field
- adding all 3 together you get regimes <10GHz syncho dominates, 10-100 GHz free free, >100GHz dust 
- delta T_rms = T_sys/(nu*Tau)^0.5
- nu is bandwidth and Tau is integration
#### Questions
- Faraday Rotation - Learn information regarding the recovering direction of magnetic field

### Mark McKinnon - General Interferometry 
#### Presentation
- A*Omega = lambda^2 ..... Effective area (gain) * solid Angle <= wavelength squared. Can have large gain or large omega but not both
- corregation within receiver to minimize feed horn size
- beam efficiency.... Ruze equation nsf = exp(-(4pisigma/lambda)^2) where sigma is wavelength related surface error (sigma~ lambda/16 then nsf ~0.5) 
- For radio telescope need to calculate the angle of the signal reflected from the telescope to determine what the size of the feed horn needs to be and distance
- Ask Mark for the pointing model
#### Questions

### Rick Perley - Interferometry (3 lectures)......favourite lecturer
#### Presentation
- "White book" Baron Clark.. Bible of interferometry of extended sources---intferferometry and sythesis for radio astronomy thomson swinson
- QM process of downconverting found in the SIW white booklet
- "Fourier transform and applications"
- Barry Clark 3d transform solytion

## 2018 05 17
### Dan Marrone -- High Redshift

### George -- Calibration

### David Wilner

### Crystal Brogan
#### Question
- ALMA uses the Hot load cold load (Vane calibrator)
- VLA uses the noise diode method. How do you correct for temperature dependence?
- She mentioned base,ine based self calibration instead of antenna based self calibration, possibly could use for source. Just refers to aplitude self cal
- is it best to chose a solint based on the SNR? Yes
